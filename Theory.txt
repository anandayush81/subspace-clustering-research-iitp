GA – Motivation
Genetic Algorithms have the ability to deliver a “good-enough” solution “fast-enough”. This makes genetic algorithms attractive for use in solving optimization problems. The reasons why GAs are needed are as follows −

Solving Difficult Problems
In computer science, there is a large set of problems, which are NP-Hard. What this essentially means is that, even the most powerful computing systems take a very long time (even years!) to solve that problem. In such a scenario, GAs prove to be an efficient tool to provide usable near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time.

Failure of Gradient Based Methods
Traditional calculus based methods work by starting at a random point and by moving in the direction of the gradient, till we reach the top of the hill. This technique is efficient and works very well for single-peaked objective functions like the cost function in linear regression. But, in most real-world situations, we have a very complex problem called as landscapes, which are made of many peaks and many valleys, which causes such methods to fail, as they suffer from an inherent tendency of getting stuck at the local optima
