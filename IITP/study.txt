You also need to study Non-dominating Sorting and Crowding distance. Please go through this.

Some basic concept:

Clustering is a grouping of a similar object (also called data) in the same group and the objects (or data) that are not similar will be placed in a different group.
Generally, a data (or object) is represented with many features (also called dimensions).
But, all the features that are used to represent a data are not relevant. Some redundant or irrelevant features are also there to represent a data.
These irrelevant or redundant data degrades the cluster quality and has to be removed.
Feature selection and Feature reduction are used to identify and removal of these irrelevant features. 

With respect to Multiobjective optimization:

Generally, we represent each cluster in a circular shape.
where the objectives are compactness (within a cluster the objects must be closely spaced wrt cluster center) and separation (distance between each cluster should be more).
So, we have to minimize the compactness and maximize the separation.
All the indices (including XB-index and PBM-index ) are functions of compactness and separation. They are represented in different ways based on a different theoretical concept.

I hope this information will be helpful for your further study.
