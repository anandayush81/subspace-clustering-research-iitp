This repository contains the codes and documents of summer reasearch project that I completed at the Department of Computer Science at IIT Patna.
I worked on an algorithm for improving subspace clustering of static and streaming data using multi-objective optimization and the analysis of resulting clusters as a research intern. 
Contributed to the publication of the resulting research paper.
Th tech stack used was Python, K-Means Clustering, Machine Learning Algorithms, data handling and transformations using Python libraries like numpy, and pandas amongst others.
Tools used were Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda.
